# React Clock and Timer App

This is a simple React application that displays a clock and a timer. The clock shows the current time, while the timer allows users to set a countdown and play a sound when the timer ends.

## Features

- **Clock**: Displays the current time in either 12-hour or 24-hour format. Users can toggle between the two formats.
- **Timer**: Allows users to set a countdown timer in minutes and seconds. Plays a sound when the timer reaches zero.
- **Responsive Layout**:
  - The clock is positioned at the top-right corner of the browser.
  - The timer is positioned at the bottom-left corner of the browser.

## Technologies Used

- React (with hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`)
- Vite (for fast development and optimized builds)
- JavaScript
- CSS (inline styling for layout and design)
